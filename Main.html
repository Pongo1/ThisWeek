                            It is with deep sorrow that we would like to inform you of the dissapearance of our valued peer Chimfeka. After countless days of searching, some people have reported seeing him only in the dinning hall during lunch. This is becoming a real issue. Many students have gone missing and people are worried.However, the second year students are not worried. They say that its the SAT prep syndrome. It is a disease that affects first years during the third term, and the second years during the first term. The symptoms are very distinguishable: constant yawning, troubled sleep paterns, missing breakfast, sleeping in classs and dissapearance from the ALA community. 
With the SAT test approaching, many first year students are preparing for it alongside doing their homework, preparing for class quizzes, completing thier extracurricular activities and duties. Some students started their preparation months prior to the "SAT season", while others have just started. The African Leaderhip Acadmy is however, ensuring that the students have necessary support they need to attain high scores in this test. In fact, the student government has put in place an SAT tutoring program and a weekly full SAT practice on Sundays thanks to the chair person Kamil Kamour form Morocco and Libbya, Stephanie Mbida from USA, Germany and Cameroon, and the Acdemic rep Dumebi Akukwe from Nigeria

                        <p>
                            Athe the start of the Mocks, eighteen Year 2 Biology students were treated to an unlikely surprise, a mock for their mocks. The year 2 students who were set to sit for Biology Paper 2 were unlikely to their expectations, surprised with a Paper 3 paper for their mock exam. The 'mock' evoked mixed reactions of frustration, delight and disappointment among candidates who put much of their time to prepare for their Biology Paper 2 with an intention of a fresh kick start to their mocks. Mr Du Aimae, a 'new' Biology teaching fellow who admininstered the 'mock' was seemingly taken aback as well by giving the wrong test and apologized to the candidates before he put off the test to a later date. It is however unclear of the factors influencing the 'error'. "The pain came from the realization that we lost hours of sleep only to be surprise with the wrong paper. In truth, we weren't too surprised." said a source who politely declined to be named.
Nontheless, the mishap created a window for the candidates to kick in some final preps for their upcoming paper, particularly for students who had Math papers later that day. 
Following this, it is highly unlikely for any other mock-for-mocks show down to spring up, which would have a bitter-sweet taste to it. 
We, as part of ALA's newsletter board wish our Year 2s the best of luck as they take their mock, despite its highly grueling nature. 
In other news, a section of year one students are set to take part in a seires of mock sessions by potential teaching fellows in part of a process to recruit additional teaching staff in select subjects. The lessons, which task the students to extensive feedback include: Math and Literature. 
In the latest mock lesson, a select twelve students were part of a skyped pure math class on Integration. Other sections are set to take place in the coming weeks.
